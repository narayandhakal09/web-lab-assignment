### CSS Selectors

* A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.
* Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
* Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
* Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
* Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
* Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

### CSS Box Model

* In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout

### Explanation of the different parts

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
* The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

### CSS Margins

The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
